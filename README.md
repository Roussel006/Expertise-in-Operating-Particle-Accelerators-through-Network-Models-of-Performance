In this work, we investigated how humans learn the extremely complex task of operating particle accelerators. We adopt a new approach to model complex task performance (directly as networks or graphs of the task elements) and investigated the changes with expertise at different levels of the networks. We found several interesting changes. For example, we find that all operators adopt a common "divide-and-conquer" strategy in breaking up the whole task into parts. On the other hand, we also find differences in the frequency of these parts.
